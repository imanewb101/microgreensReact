            nourishes, and comforts. It must be fresh, delicious, and versatile.</p>

                <p className="pt-3">At MicroWorld, our seeds are not genetically modified. We donâ€™t use pesticides or herbacides. We grow in
                coconut coir, with some help from earthworm castings, and compost--you know, stuff you might find in the ground.</p>
                
                <p>We grow microgreens exposed to the outdoors with natural sunlight and fluctuations in temperature from day-to-night and
                from summer-to-winter. Microgreens are drought-friendly.</p>
                
                <p>After harvesting, roots and leftover microgreen stems become food for our chickens, worms, quail, or compost. We reuse
                our growing trays, and will even reuse the trays bought by our market customers. Our goal is to grow in step with nature
                and provide great, nutritious food for our community.</p>
